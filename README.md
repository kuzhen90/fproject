## The Two App Ideas

### 1. Daily Check-In (Senior Wellness)

**One-Line Pitch:** Peace of mind for families with aging parents - without surveillance.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Size (2024) | $4.58 billion |
| Projected (2033) | $16.87 billion |
| CAGR | 13.92% |
| Competition | **0 apps in top 100 health apps** |

**How it works:**
- Senior taps one emoji daily: "How are you feeling?"
- Family gets dashboard showing all parents' status
- Alerts if no check-in by set time
- Optional voice notes/photos for connection

**Why it wins:** Dignity-first design. Zero competition. Built-in test users (your parents).

### 2. Sleep Coach AI (Sleep Tech)

**One-Line Pitch:** Your personal sleep coach that learns what works for YOU.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Size (2024) | $3.98 billion |
| Projected (2033) | $17.5 billion |
| CAGR | 17.9% |
| Gap | No app combines tracking + personalized content + CBT-I |

**How it works:**
- Week 1: Sleep diary + AI assessment
- Ongoing: Personalized nightly recommendations
- AI learns YOUR patterns and adjusts
- Insights like "You sleep 40min longer without screens after 9pm"

**Why it wins:** Personalization gap in crowded market. AI differentiation.

## Why These Markets?

| Factor | Senior Check-In | Sleep Coach AI |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Competition | Almost none | Very crowded |
| Differentiation | Easy | Requires strong AI |
| Monetization | High confidence | Medium (high churn) |
| B2B Potential | High | Medium |
| Development | 2 apps | 1 app |

**Recommendation:** Start with Senior Check-In due to zero competition and high B2B expansion potential.
