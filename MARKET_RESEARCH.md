Per Bain & Company's Technology Report 2025: "Halfway through the decade, it's clear that AI is the defining disrupter of our time. AI's reach is broader than any recent tech wave, reshaping business strategy, politics, trade, defense, and even social justice."

> **Source:** [Bain & Company, "Technology Report 2025"](https://www.bain.com/insights/topics/technology-report/)

**Key AI Statistics:**
- **72%** of organizations adopted AI in 2024 (up from ~50% in previous years)
- **65%** of respondents are leveraging generative AI tools (nearly 2x from 2023)
- **95%** of organizations will adopt AI-powered SaaS applications by 2025
- **87%** of SaaS companies report improved growth rates through AI-driven personalization
- Leaders using AI are improving EBITDA by **10-25%**

> **Source:** [McKinsey, "Technology Trends Outlook 2025"](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/the-top-trends-in-tech)

**Agentic AI is the Next Frontier:**

Per Deloitte Tech Trends 2025: "At full potential, AI agents will run complete processes and workflows." The concept of "IT Amplified" suggests agentic AI tools will empower workers, redefining the IT function.

### 2.2 Vertical SaaS Ascendancy

**Horizontal SaaS is Vulnerable; Vertical SaaS is Defensible**

Analysis of 2025 B2B stock performance reveals a stark bifurcation:
- **Winners:** Veeva (+142%), Guidewire, Palantir - companies serving specific verticals where domain expertise creates defensibility
- **Losers:** Broad horizontal use cases (CRM, marketing, creative, work management)

> **Source:** [SaaStr, "The Great B2B Bifurcation of 2025"](https://www.saastr.com/the-performing-major-b2b-stocks-of-2025-what-the-ai-divide-tells-us-about-the-future-of-saas/)

**Why Vertical SaaS Wins:**
- "Horizontal tools are easier to disrupt because the problem space is general. AI can attack general problems more easily than specialized ones."
- **44%** of all SaaS M&A deals in 2024 involved vertically focused companies
- Vertical SaaS market expected to reach **$157.4 billion by 2025** (23.9% CAGR)

### 2.3 Cloud-First Architecture

**Cloud Adoption Delivers Measurable ROI:**
- McKinsey analysis: Cloud adoption among Forbes Global 2000 generates EBITDA value exceeding **$1 trillion**, with projections reaching **$3 trillion by 2030**
- Cloud adoption delivers **5-9% absolute EBITDA lift** across industries
- **85%** of business applications will be SaaS-based by 2025

## Notes & Limitations

1. **Source Variation:** Market size estimates vary significantly between research firms ($232B to $461B for 2024). This analysis uses ranges to reflect this uncertainty.

2. **Proprietary Reports:** Some investment banking research (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley) is not publicly available. Insights were gathered from public summaries and secondary sources.

3. **Snowflake Report:** The full PDF (Modern Marketing Data Stack 2026) could not be directly parsed due to file size. Insights were gathered from the landing page and vendor press releases.

4. **Forward-Looking Statements:** Projections for 2030+ should be treated as directional rather than precise, given the rapid pace of technological change.

5. **Regional Bias:** Most available research focuses heavily on North American and European markets. Emerging market data may be less comprehensive.
